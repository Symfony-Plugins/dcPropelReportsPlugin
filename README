# dcPropelReportsPlugin #

## Introduction ##
This plugin provides a custom generation of reports in a graphical fashion, 
allowing end users to build ang get their custom reports.


Report creation is done by a Query by Example way, and some restrictions are 
imposed, but it seems to be very useful in many scenarios.

## Requirements ##
  * This plugin, as its name suggest it only works with Propel Objects. 
  * Prototype JS
  * sfPhpExcelPlugin to export report results to Excel file.

## Installation ##

For report creation and administration you should enable the followoing modules:

  * dc_report_query: main report administration module
  * dc_report_table: table and relations administration for a single report
  * dc_report_condition: condition filtering administration (Query by Example) for a single report
  * dc_report_field: columns to be shown fo a single report
  * dc_report_filter: filters that will be aplied to the list of report query.


For accessing reports created you should only enable the following modules:

  * dc_report_list: report renderization
  * dc_report_public: browse published reports


## Cofiguration ##
The default number of rows to display in a dc_report_list module is 20. If you wanna change this number add the next parameter in your app.yml 

  app_dc_report_query:
    list_rows:     20

The default number of rows to export to excel in a dc_report_list module is 20. If you wanna change this number add the next parameter in your app.yml 

  app_dc_report_query:
    export_rows:     20

The way to access a generated report is by the following symfony route:

  dc_report_list/:name:

where :name: is the unique name of a report previously created
